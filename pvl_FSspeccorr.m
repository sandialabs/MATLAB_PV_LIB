function [M] = pvl_FSspeccorr(Pwat,AMa,varargin)
% pvl_FSspeccorr  Spectral mismatch modifier based on precipitable water and 
%  absolute (pressure corrected) airmass.
% 
% Syntax:
%   [M] = pvl_FSspeccorr(Pwat, AMa, pvModType) 
%   [M] = pvl_FSspeccorr(Pwat, AMa, custCoeff)
%
% Description:
%   
%   Estimates a spectral mismatch modifier M representing the effect on 
%   module short circuit current of variation in the spectral irradiance.  
%   M is estimated from absolute (pressure currected) air mass, AMa, and
%   precipitable water, Pwat, using the following function:
%
%   M = coeff(1) + coeff(2)*AMa  + coeff(3)*Pwat  + coeff(4)*AMa.^.5  
%           + coeff(5)*Pwat.^.5 + coeff(6)*AMa./Pwat.^0.5         (1) 
%
%   Default coefficients are determined for several cell types with 
%   known quantum efficiency curves, by using the Simple Model of the 
%   Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine (SMARTS) [1]. 
%   Using SMARTS, spectrums are simulated with all combinations of AMa 
%   and Pwat where:
%       *   0.1 cm <= Pwat <= 5 cm
%       *   1.0 <= AMa <= 5 
%       *   Spectral range is limited to that of CMP11 (280 nm to 2800 nm)
%       *   spectrum simulated on a plane normal to the sun
%       *   All other parameters fixed at G173 standard
%   From these simulated spectra, M is calculated using the known quantum 
%   efficiency curves. Multiple linear regression is then applied to fit 
%   Eq. 1 to determine the coefficients for each module.
%
%  Function pvl_FSspeccorr was developed by Mitchell Lee and Alex Panchula,
%   at First Solar, 2015. Detailed description of spectral correction 
%   can be found in [2] 
%
% Inputs:
%   Pwat - atmospheric precipitable water (cm). Can be
%       entered as a vector.
%   AMa - absolute (pressure corrected) airmass, as a vector of the same 
%       length as Pwat
%   pvModType - a string specifying a cell type. Can be lower or upper case 
%       letters.  Admits values of 'cdte', 'monosi'='xsi', 'multisi'='polysi'.
%       If provided, this input
%       selects coefficients for the following default modules:
%           'cdte' - coefficients for First Solar Series 4-2 CdTe modules. 
%           'monosi','xsi' - coefficients for First Solar TetraSun modules.
%           'multisi','polysi' - coefficients for multi-crystalline silicon 
%               modules. The module used to calculate the spectral
%               correction coefficients corresponds to the Mult-crystalline 
%               silicon Manufacturer 2 Model C from [3].
%   custCoeff - allows for entry of user defined spectral correction
%       coefficients. Coefficients must be entered as a numeric row or 
%       column vector of length 6. Derivation of coefficients requires use 
%       of SMARTS and PV module quantum efficiency curve. Useful for modeling 
%       PV module types which are not included as defaults, or to fine tune
%       the spectral correction to a particular mono-Si, multi-Si, or CdTe 
%       PV module. Note that the parameters for modules with very
%       similar QE should be similar, in most cases limiting the need for
%       module specific coefficients.
%
%
% Output:
%   M - spectral mismatch factor (unitless) which is can be multiplied
%       with broadband irradiance reaching a module's cells to estimate
%       effective irradiance, i.e., the irradiance that is converted
%       to electrical current.
